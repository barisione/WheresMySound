Where's My Sound
================

Have you ever accidentally started playing music from your laptop speakers because you thought your headphones were connected?

*Where's My Sound* adds an icon in the status area of your macOS desktop showing what kind of device is currently selected for playing audio.

For more details, see the [app's website](https://barisione.github.io/WheresMySound).
